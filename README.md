# Contao DevMode

This is a tiny contao extension which simply appends tl_settings with an "Activate Developer mode" checkbox.
Can be used by developers who want to activate some special functionalities within developer mode (for example
load unminified JS files in Developer Mode and so on).

Only works with Contao v3.
